#SketchBot

This is a robot of sorts to drive an Etch-a-sketch. With it you can plot arbitrary single-line paths. A _Turtle Graphics_ implimentation is provided for children to learn programming and robotics. A voronoi stippling tool is provides which, along with a Traveling Salesman solver, [can convert photographs to single-lines suitable for plotting](http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/projects/tsp/).
