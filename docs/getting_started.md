# Getting Started

Let's make sure everything is set up and make our first piece of art.

## SketchBot Snap Integration

Snap is an amazingly flexible programming environment. It is friendly enough for children who can't even read this guide, and it is powerful enough to teach advanced concepts to adults.

> In the glory days of the MIT Logo Lab, we used to say, “Logo is Lisp disguised as BASIC.” Now, with its first class procedures, lexical scope, and first class continuations, Snap! is Scheme disguised as Scratch.

We have customized and sharpened it to make art on the SketchBot.

There is nothing to install to use Snap. Simply visit http://snap.berkeley.edu/run. Next, import the SketchBot environment (`frontend/sketchbot.xml`). As a teacher, you may want to save this project to the Snap cloud for students to access.

## Hello World

Have you ever tried to draw a perfect circle on an Etch A Sketch? Not easy for a human, but to a robot it's no more difficult than a straight line.

Sketch programs are placed within a `sketch` block:

A circle can be easily approximated by a polygon with many sides:
